No fluff, just as many details as can be fit into a reasonably sized book; synthesising all the available public material & private interviews with many of the engineers and scientists involved in the design of the rover and its experiments.<br/><br/>Most astonishing for me is that the book is extremely readable. I didn't expect to read it from cover to cover, but that's exactly what I did, within two days. It was hard to put down!<br/><br/>Strongly recommended for anyone with even a passing interest in space exploration or big science/engineering projects in general (the stories about how the team worked around various issues that cropped up after landing are particularly fascinating).<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to the sequel; after learning about all the instruments I can't wait to find out what they can tell us about Mars.",,,1,,,0,,,,,,"2018-05-22,2018-05-23","Science|12;Space|5;Nonfiction|2;Science,Technology|2;Science,Engineering|2"
